/* Q5 a query that returns "how exactly the advertisers target the user; 
that is, you want to see the top ten advertisers and, for each of these ten advertisers, 
their top ten combinations of targeting type and targeting value".

The query should return a table with three columns labeled 
"Advertiser" (text), "Criteria Type" (text), and "Criterion" (text).

The query should not modify the database and be a single SQL statement.  */
